# Migration Plan: Xenko → Flax

The goal is to migrate the game in it's current form from Xenko to Flax. This plan outlines the current status and what is to be expected in the future. 

# Current Status

### Flax:

- Player

  - Camera, including a special effect when the player is near an edge

  - Tachyonen-Insignifikator (Gun, used to change the time)

- Pausing (no menu yet)

- Interacting with objects

  - GUI pops up

  - Player can press the "interact key" to interact

- **Regarding level loading, this won't be an issue with Flax since Flax supports it really well out of the box**

- **Menus are working, however they are unfinished**

- **1st level (took at least 8 hours to create, using Xenko, it would take far longer)**

  - **A large cave with a chasm and a bridge**

  - **Rocks blocking the way --> Gun must be used to remove them**

  - **Interactive door**

### Xenko:

- Player

  - Movement

  - FPS-Camera, including a special effect when the player is near an edge

  - Tachyonen-Insignifikator (Gun, used to change the time)

- Pausing (no menu yet)

- Interacting with objects

  - GUI pops up

  - Player can press the "interact key" to interact

- Level loading (Note: No level has been finished so far)

  - Trigger areas which cause the next level to get loaded

  - Nice game studio integration

- Started work on a the menus (main menu, pause menu)

# This week

## Goals:

- Remote Desktop or some other solution

- Arno being familiar with Flax

- Stefan working on the game, however, his main focus will be getting Arno up to date.

## Today:

- Getting Flax: Done

  - Engine & Editor: Done

  - Joining the Flax community: Done

- Running Flax at home

- Remote Desktop Test

## Tomorrow:

- Testing the remote desktop stuff at school (2nd period)

  This will require the following equipment:

  - Lan Cable: Arno will bring one

  - USB Type C <--> LAN: Stefan will bring one

- Cloning the Flax Time Nexus repository and opening it (opening the Flax implementation of the game)

## Thursday:

- Arno familiarizes himself with Flax

## Friday:

- Resolving potential issues (remote desktop)
- Setting a goal for the weekend (who should achieve what by Tuesday)
- Writing a tiny status report and sending it to Prof. Bauer

# 5th June - expected status

## Flax

- Arno should be able to work on the project

- The main menu and pause menu should be implemented:

  - Main menu: `Play` and `Exit` buttons

  - Pause menu: `Resume/Unpause`, `Exit` buttons. Placeholders for other buttons such as `Save/Load`, `Settings`

## Xenko

Same as above. I'm really not expecting anything better than that, since using Xenko, most of the menu stuff has to be implemented manually.

# 12th June - expected status



# 19th June - expected status

# 26th June - expected status
